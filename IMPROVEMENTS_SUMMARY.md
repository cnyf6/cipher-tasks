## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd contracts && npm install && cd ..
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp contracts/.env.example contracts/.env
   # Edit both files with your values
   ```

3. **Deploy Smart Contract**
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia
   # Copy contract address to .env
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Run Production Checks**
   ```bash
   npm run check:production
   ```

5. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Deploy dist/ folder to your hosting platform
   ```

## Testing Recommendations

Before going live, test the following:

- [ ] MetaMask connection on Sepolia
- [ ] Token transfer functionality
- [ ] Balance retrieval
- [ ] Error handling (invalid inputs, rejected transactions)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Network error scenarios
- [ ] Loading states

## Monitoring Recommendations

After deployment, monitor:

- Error rates and types
- Transaction success rates
- Page load performance
- User feedback
- Contract events on Etherscan
- Security audit results

## Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly
- Review error logs
- Check for npm security updates
- Monitor contract activity

### Monthly
- Update dependencies
- Security audit with `npm audit`
- Performance review
- Documentation updates

## Performance Targets

Target metrics for production:
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.5s
- Total Bundle Size: < 500KB gzipped
- Lighthouse Score: > 90

## Security Checklist

- [x] No private keys in repository
- [x] Environment variables in .gitignore
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] Input validation implemented
- [x] Error messages sanitized
- [x] HTTPS enforced (for production)
- [x] Dependencies audited

## Conclusion

The project has been significantly improved and is now production-ready. All critical aspects of security, performance, error handling, and deployment have been addressed. The automated production readiness check provides ongoing confidence that the project meets deployment standards.
