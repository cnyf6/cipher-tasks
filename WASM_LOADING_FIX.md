# WASM Loading Fix - Final Solution

## Problem
The FHE SDK WASM files were returning HTML (404 pages) instead of binary WASM, causing the error:
```
WebAssembly.instantiate(): expected magic word 00 61 73 6d, found 3c 21 64 6f
```

## Root Cause
Vite's module bundling system was unable to properly handle the Zama FHE SDK's WASM file loading mechanism. The SDK expects WASM files to be available at specific paths relative to the bundle.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Load SDK via UMD Bundle (`index.html`)
Changed from ES module imports to UMD bundle loading:

```html
<!-- Load FHE SDK UMD bundle first -->
<script src="/node_modules/@zama-fhe/relayer-sdk/bundle/relayer-sdk-js.umd.cjs"></script>
<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
```

The UMD bundle creates a global `window.relayerSDK` object that the application can use.

### 2. Copy WASM Files to Public Directory
Copied required WASM files and worker helpers to `/public/`:
- `kms_lib_bg.wasm` (638 KB)
- `tfhe_bg.wasm` (4.4 MB)
- `workerHelpers.js` (29 KB)

These files are now served as static assets, accessible to the SDK.

### 3. Updated Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
```typescript
fs: {
  allow: [
    path.resolve(__dirname),
    path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules'),  // Allow access to node_modules
  ],
},
```

Added middleware to set correct MIME types:
```typescript
{
  name: 'fhe-sdk-middleware',
  configureServer(server: any) {
    server.middlewares.use((req: IncomingMessage, res: ServerResponse, next: () => void) => {
      if (req.url) {
        if (req.url.endsWith('.wasm')) {
          res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/wasm');
        }
        if (req.url.includes('.umd.cjs')) {
          res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/javascript');
        }
      }
      next();
    });
  },
}
```

### 4. Keep FHE Initialization Code (`src/utils/fhe.ts`)
The existing code already uses `window.relayerSDK`, so no changes needed here:

```typescript
// Wait for SDK bundle to load
await waitForSDK();
const sdk = window.relayerSDK!;

// Initialize and create instance
await sdk.initSDK();
const instance = await sdk.createInstance(sdk.SepoliaConfig);
```

## How It Works

1. Browser loads `index.html`
2. UMD bundle loads first, creating `window.relayerSDK`
3. React app loads via module
4. When Transfer button is clicked, `initializeFHE()` is called
5. Function waits for `window.relayerSDK` to be available
6. SDK initializes and loads WASM files from `/public/`
7. WASM files are served with correct MIME type
8. FHE encryption works correctly

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Navigate to the Token page: http://localhost:8080/token
2. Click the "Transfer" button
3. Enter a recipient address and amount
4. Submit the transfer
5. The FHE SDK should initialize successfully without WASM errors

## Files Modified

- `index.html` - Added UMD bundle script tag
- `vite.config.ts` - Updated fs.allow and added MIME type middleware
- `/public/` - Added WASM files and worker helpers
- `src/utils/fhe.ts` - No changes (already compatible)

## Why This Works

The UMD bundle approach bypasses Vite's module resolution system entirely. The SDK loads as a traditional browser global, and WASM files are served as static assets. This is the recommended approach for packages with complex WASM dependencies that don't play well with modern bundlers.

## Alternative Approaches Tried (That Failed)

1. ❌ Dynamic imports - Module resolution still failed
2. ❌ Excluding from optimization - WASM paths still incorrect
3. ❌ Copying to public/fhe-sdk/ - Path resolution issues
4. ❌ Using ES module exports - Incompatible with Vite bundling

The UMD + static assets approach is the most reliable solution for this SDK.
